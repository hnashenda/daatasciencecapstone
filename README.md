# Applied Data Science Capstone

![Intro Slide](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fd0cb380-837f-49c4-bd9e-a6ad944dc975)

## Project scenario

In this capstone, you will take the role of a data scientist working for a new rocket company. Space Y that would like to compete with SpaceX founded by Billionaire industrialist Allon Mask. Your job is to determine the price of each launch. You will do this by gathering information about Space X and creating dashboards for your team. You will also determine if SpaceX will reuse the first stage. Instead of using rocket science to determine if the first stage will land successfully, you will train a machine learning model and use public information to predict if SpaceX will reuse the first stage.

## Business Problem
SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website, with a cost of 62 million dollars; other providers cost upward of 165 million dollars each, much of the savings is because SpaceX can reuse the first stage. Therefore if you can accurately predict the likelihood of the first stage rocket landing successfully, you can determine the cost of a launch. With the help of your Data Science findings and models, the competing startup you have been hired by can make more informed bids against SpaceX for a rocket launch.

## Objective
To apply data science toolkit and machine learning in order to accurately predict the likelihood of the first stage rocket landing successfully, and thus determine the cost of a launch.
Explore the data in order to obtain more insight from the data.
